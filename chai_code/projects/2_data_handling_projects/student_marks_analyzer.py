 Challenge: Student Marks Analyzer

Create a Python program that allows a user to input student names along with their marks and then calculates useful statistics.

Your program should:
1. Let the user input multiple students with their marks (name + integer score).
2. After input is complete, display:
   - Average marks
   - Highest marks and student(s) who scored it
   - Lowest marks and student(s) who scored it
   - Total number of students

Bonus:
- Allow the user to enter all data first, then view the report
- Format output clearly in a report-style layout
- Prevent duplicate student names
